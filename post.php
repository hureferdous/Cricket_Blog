            <p>15 September 2005, Grace Road, Leicester. Sri Lanka's Chilaw Marians CC meet a PCA Masters XI in the opening game of Group B in the inaugural (and as it turns out, final) International T20 Club Championship. Chris Gayle steps onto the field to play T20 cricket for the first time. He opens the bowling and concedes 16 runs from his only over. The game is abandoned due to rain and decided by a bowl-off at the indoor school. His second match, later the same day against South Africa's champion club Titans, is also decided by bowl-off. Two days later, Gayle bats in a T20 match for the first time. He makes 11 from ten deliveries, clean bowled by Samiullah Khan of Faisalabad Wolves. T20 cricket is so new, there are no representatives from Australia, New Zealand or West Indies in the International T20 Club Championship because they don't yet have domestic competitions. Faisalabad Wolves win the tournament. They receive Â£25,000. </p>
