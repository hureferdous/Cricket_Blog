            <p>15 September 2005, Grace Road, Leicester. Sri Lanka's Chilaw Marians CC meet a PCA Masters XI in the opening game of Group B in the inaugural (and as it turns out, final) International T20 Club Championship. Chris Gayle steps onto the field to play T20 cricket for the first time. He opens the bowling and concedes 16 runs from his only over. The game is abandoned due to rain and decided by a bowl-off at the indoor school. </p>
